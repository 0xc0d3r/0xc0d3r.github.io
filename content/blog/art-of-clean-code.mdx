# The Art of Clean Code

Writing clean code is more than just following style guides. It's about creating code that tells a story, is easy to understand, and delightful to work with.

## Key Principles

### 1. Meaningful Names

Choose names that reveal intent:

```typescript
// Bad
const d = new Date();
const arr = users.filter(u => u.a);

// Good
const currentDate = new Date();
const activeUsers = users.filter(user => user.isActive);
```

### 2. Small Functions

Functions should do one thing and do it well:

```typescript
// Instead of one large function
function processUserData(user) {
  // 100 lines of code
}

// Break it down
function validateUser(user) { /* ... */ }
function formatUserData(user) { /* ... */ }
function saveUser(user) { /* ... */ }
```

### 3. Comments Wisely

Code should be self-documenting. Use comments for "why", not "what":

```typescript
// Bad: What the code does
// Add 1 to counter
counter++;

// Good: Why we're doing it
// Compensate for off-by-one error in legacy API
counter++;
```

## The Boy Scout Rule

> "Leave the code better than you found it."

Every time you touch code, make a small improvement:
- Rename a confusing variable
- Extract a helper function
- Add a missing type annotation

## Testing is Documentation

Well-written tests serve as living documentation:

```typescript
describe('ShoppingCart', () => {
  it('should apply discount when coupon is valid', () => {
    // This test tells you exactly what the feature does
  });

  it('should reject expired coupons', () => {
    // And what it shouldn't do
  });
});
```

## Conclusion

Clean code is a journey, not a destination. Keep learning, refactoring, and improving. Your future self (and teammates) will thank you!
